BasicAuthentication:
   generally only appropriate for testing.

SessionAuthentication:
   appropriate for AJAX clients that are running in the same 
   session context as your website.

TokenAuthentication:
   appropriate for client-server setups, 
   such as native desktop and mobile clients.

RemoteUserAuthentication:
   allows you to delegate authentication to your web server, 
   which sets the REMOTE_USER environment variable.
